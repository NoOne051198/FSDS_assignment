    "<font size = 3>__1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?__</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ans:__ Both def statements and lambda expressions in Python are used to define functions. The main difference is that def statements create named functions with a block of code, while lambda expressions create anonymous functions as expressions. Lambda expressions are typically used for simpler and one-line functions, while def statements are more versatile and can contain multiple statements and have a name for reusability."

    "<font size = 3>__2. What is the benefit of lambda?__</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ans:__ The primary benefit of using lambda expressions in Python is that they allow for the creation of small, anonymous functions without the need for a formal function definition. This can make code more concise and easier to read, particularly when using functions as arguments to other functions, such as in map(), filter(), and reduce() operations. Lambda expressions are also often used in conjunction with sorting and other data manipulation operations, as they can provide a quick and efficient way to define custom comparison functions."

    "\n",
    "__Ans:__ Function annotations in Python are a way to add metadata or type hints to function parameters and return values. They provide additional information about the types or expected values of function inputs and outputs. Annotations are optional and do not affect the actual execution of the function. They can be defined using the : syntax after the parameter or return value name. Annotations can be used by tools or libraries for static type checking, documentation generation, or runtime introspection."

    "\n",
    "__Ans:__ Recursive functions are functions that call themselves during their execution. They are used to solve problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems of the same nature. A recursive function typically has a base case that specifies the termination condition and one or more recursive cases that call the function again with a smaller or simpler input. Recursive functions can be used to solve problems like calculating factorials, finding Fibonacci numbers, traversing tree structures, and more. They provide an elegant and concise way to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems."
