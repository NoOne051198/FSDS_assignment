    "\n",
    "__Ans:__ Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit attributes and behaviors from more than one parent class. It allows a subclass to inherit and combine the features of multiple classes, enabling code reuse and creating complex class hierarchies."

    "__Ans:__ Delegation is a design pattern that involves one object forwarding or delegating a specific task to another object to handle it. Rather than directly performing the task itself, the delegating object relies on the delegated object to carry out the task. Delegation promotes code reuse, modularity, and separation of concerns, allowing objects to collaborate by assigning specific responsibilities to each other."

It allows objects to be combined to form more complex structures or behaviors. Composition enables code reuse, flexibility, and modularity by promoting the creation of classes that collaborate and interact with each other to achieve desired functionality."

    "__Ans:__ Bound methods are functions that are associated with a specific instance of a class. They are created when accessing a method on an instance of a class. Bound methods are automatically passed the instance as the first argument (usually named self). They encapsulate the behavior and state of the instance. Bound methods can be invoked directly on the instance, allowing access to the instance's attributes and behavior defined in the class."

    "__Ans:__ The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes, also known as name mangling, is to provide a way to make class attributes less accessible outside the class. It allows attributes to be prefixed with double underscores (\\_\\_) to indicate that they are intended for internal use within the class. This naming convention helps avoid accidental name clashes with subclasses or external code, promoting encapsulation and reducing the risk of unintended modification or access to class internals."
