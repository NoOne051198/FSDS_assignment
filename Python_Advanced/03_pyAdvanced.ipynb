    "__Ans:__ An abstract class/superclass can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class.\n",

    "__Ans:__ When a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement, it creates a class variable that is shared among all instances of the class. The assignment statement outside any method in the class body is executed only once when the class is defined, and the assigned value is stored as a class attribute. This means that the value will be the same for all instances of the class and can be accessed using the class name or any instance of the class."

By calling the superclass's \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method, the subclass can inherit and initialize the attributes and behavior defined in the superclass. This ensures that both the superclass and subclass initialization steps are executed properly."

    "__Ans:__ To augment an inherited method instead of completely replacing it, you can override the method in the subclass and call the superclass's method using the super() function. This allows you to add extra functionality to the method while still utilizing the original implementation defined in the superclass. By calling super().method_name(), you can invoke the superclass's method and then include any additional code or modifications specific to the subclass."

    "\n",
    "1. __Accessible Variables:__ In a class, variables defined within the class body (but not inside any method) are considered class attributes and are accessible throughout the class. In contrast, variables defined within a function's scope are only accessible within that function.\n",
