    "__Ans:__ The difference between k-fold cross-validation and stratified k-fold cross-validation lies in how they handle class or label imbalances in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __K-fold Cross-Validation:__ In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds. The model is trained on k-1 folds and evaluated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the evaluation set once. However, k-fold cross-validation does not consider the distribution of classes or labels, which can be an issue if the dataset is imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Stratified K-fold Cross-Validation:__ Stratified k-fold cross-validation takes into account the class or label distribution in the dataset. It ensures that each fold contains approximately the same proportion of instances from each class as the whole dataset. This is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it helps prevent biased performance estimates and ensures that each class is represented in the evaluation process."

    "__Ans:__ To interpret cross-validation results, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Average Performance:__ Look at the average performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) across all folds. This indicates the overall performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Variance:__ Assess the variance or standard deviation of the performance metric. Higher variance suggests that the model's performance is sensitive to the specific data split, while lower variance indicates more consistent performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Comparisons:__ Compare the performance of different models or parameter settings based on the average performance and variance. Choose the model with the highest average performance and low variance for better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Bias-Variance Trade-off:__ Consider the trade-off between bias and variance. A model with high bias may consistently underperform, while a model with high variance may overfit. Look for a balance between the two."
