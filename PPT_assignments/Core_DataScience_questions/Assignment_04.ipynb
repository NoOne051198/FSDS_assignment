    "__Ans:__ Splits in a decision tree are made based on features that provide the best separation of the data. The algorithm considers different splitting criteria such as information gain, Gini impurity, or entropy. For each potential split, the algorithm calculates a metric to quantify the purity or homogeneity of the resulting subsets. It selects the split that maximizes information gain, minimizes impurity, or optimizes another chosen criterion. This process is repeated recursively for each resulting subset until a stopping condition is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or minimum number of samples per leaf."
