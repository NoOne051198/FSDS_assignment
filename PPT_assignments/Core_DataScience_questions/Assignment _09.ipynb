    "__Ans:__ Ensemble learning in the context of neural networks involves combining multiple individual neural network models to make predictions or decisions. Each individual model, known as a base learner, is trained independently on the same or different subsets of the data. The predictions of the base learners are then combined, typically by averaging or voting, to produce the final ensemble prediction. Ensemble learning helps improve the overall performance and robustness of the model by leveraging the diverse predictions and capturing a wider range of patterns in the data."
