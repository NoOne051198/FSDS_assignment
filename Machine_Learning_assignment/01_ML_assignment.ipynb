    "__Ans:__ Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to allow computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In other words, it is a process by which a machine (computer) can automatically learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions based on that learning.\n",

    "Machine learning has many applications across a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, marketing, and more. It is used for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, recommendation systems, and autonomous driving, among others"
