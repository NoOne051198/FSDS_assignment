    "__Ans:__ Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained using labeled data, where the input and output data are known. The model learns to predict the output for new, unseen inputs. It is called supervised learning because the labeled data acts as a supervisor or teacher that guides the learning process of the model. The model's performance is evaluated on how accurately it predicts the output for unseen inputs."
