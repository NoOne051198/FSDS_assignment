    "__Ans:__ Clustering is a machine learning technique that involves grouping similar data points together based on their inherent patterns or similarities. It aims to discover the underlying structure or clusters within a dataset without prior knowledge of the class labels. Some popular clustering algorithms include `k-means`, `hierarchical clustering`, `DBSCAN` (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), and `Gaussian Mixture Models` (GMM)."

    "\n",
    "1. __Elbow method:__ Plot the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The WCSS measures the compactness of the clusters. Look for the point where the decrease in WCSS begins to level off (forming an \"elbow\" shape). This point suggests that adding more clusters may not significantly improve the clustering quality.\n",

    "2. __Silhouette coefficient:__ Compute the silhouette coefficient for different numbers of clusters. The silhouette coefficient measures how well each sample fits within its assigned cluster compared to other clusters. Choose the number of clusters that maximizes the average silhouette coefficient, indicating well-separated and compact clusters.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Ans:__ Mark propagation, also known as label propagation, is a semi-supervised learning technique used to propagate labels from labeled data points to unlabeled data points in a graph or network. It works by iteratively updating the labels of unlabeled points based on the labels of their neighboring points. This approach is useful when there is a limited amount of labeled data available and can be implemented by defining appropriate rules for label updates based on the graph structure and similarity between data points."

It works by iteratively shifting points towards the mean of their local neighborhood until convergence, effectively identifying dense regions and forming clusters around them."

It is beneficial in complex domains where incremental learning is required. To put constructive learning into action, one can use techniques like incremental neural networks or ensemble methods that dynamically add and refine models based on new data or concepts."

    "\n",
    "__Ans:__ Anomaly detection and novelty detection are both techniques used to identify unusual patterns or instances in data. The main difference lies in their objectives. Anomaly detection aims to identify data points that deviate significantly from the norm, focusing on detecting outliers within the known data distribution. Novelty detection, on the other hand, focuses on identifying instances that significantly differ from the training data, aiming to detect previously unseen or unknown patterns. In summary, anomaly detection identifies deviations within the known data, while novelty detection identifies new or unfamiliar patterns."
