    "__Ans:__ Predictive models aim to forecast the outcome of a future event based on historical data. They are built using machine learning algorithms that learn from historical data to identify patterns and relationships between input variables and output variables. \n",
    "For example, `A predictive model` could be built to forecast the sales of a particular product based on historical sales data, marketing spend, and competitor activity. The model would use this data to identify the factors that are most closely correlated with sales, and then use this knowledge to make predictions about future sales.\n",

    "`Descriptive models,` on the other hand, aim to describe the relationships between different variables in a dataset. They are typically used for exploratory data analysis and visualization, and do not make predictions about future events.\n",

    "__For example,__ a descriptive model could be built to analyze customer demographics and purchasing patterns. The model would describe the relationships between different demographic variables (e.g. age, gender, income) and purchasing behavior, but would not make predictions about future purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between predictive and descriptive models is that predictive models are focused on forecasting future events, while descriptive models are focused on understanding past events. Predictive models require large amounts of historical data to train the model, while descriptive models can be built using smaller datasets."

The process involves splitting the original dataset into two subsets, one for training the model and the other for evaluating its performance.

This process is repeated ten times, with each part serving as the testing set once. The average performance metric across all ten folds is then used to assess the model's performance. This technique helps to reduce the risk of overfitting and improves the reliability of the model's performance estimation.\n",

It is an essential step in model optimization, and its goal is to obtain the best values for the hyperparameters that result in the most accurate model predictions. This is accomplished by testing different combinations of hyperparameters and assessing their impact on the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The process of adjusting the parameters is often iterative and time-consuming, requiring a balance between model complexity and generalization."

A higher purity indicates better clustering with respect to class labels, while a higher silhouette width indicates better clustering in terms of the similarity of data points within a cluster and dissimilarity between clusters.
