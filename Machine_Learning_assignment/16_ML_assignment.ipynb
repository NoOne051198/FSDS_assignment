    "__Ans:__ In a linear equation, the `dependent variable` is the variable whose value depends on the independent variable. The `independent variable` is the variable that is being manipulated or controlled to determine the value of the dependent variable. In other words, the independent variable is the input or the cause, while the dependent variable is the output or the effect. __For example,__ in the equation `y = mx + b`, `y is the dependent variable`, `x is the independent variable`, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept. The value of y is determined by the value of x."

    "__Ans:__ Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between two or more independent variables and a dependent variable. It extends simple linear regression by allowing multiple predictors to be used to estimate a response variable. It works by fitting a line or hyperplane to the observed data in a way that minimizes the sum of the squared errors between the predicted and actual values. This model can then be used to make predictions for new values of the independent variables."
