It is updated using Bayes' theorem, which combines prior probabilities with the likelihood of the evidence to obtain a new and improved probability. __For example,__ after seeing a positive result in a medical test with a known false positive rate, the posterior probability of having a disease can be calculated based on the prior probability of the disease in the population and the likelihood of the test result given the presence or absence of the disease."

    "\n",
    "1. __Text classification:__ In text classification, Naive Bayes classifier is trained on a large dataset of labeled text documents. The algorithm then predicts the class of the new, unlabeled document based on the probability of the words in the document belonging to each class. For example, the algorithm can classify news articles into different categories such as politics, sports, entertainment, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Spam filtering:__ Naive Bayes classifier is commonly used for spam filtering in email systems. The algorithm is trained on a dataset of spam and non-spam emails, and then it can classify new incoming emails as either spam or not based on the probability of the words in the email being associated with spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Market sentiment analysis:__ Naive Bayes classifier can also be used for market sentiment analysis. In this application, the algorithm is trained on a dataset of stock prices and news articles related to a particular stock or industry. The algorithm then predicts the sentiment of the market towards the stock based on the probability of the words in the news articles being associated with positive or negative sentiment. This information can be used to make informed investment decisions."
